### Description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chatbyte is socket programmed chat application. 
It offers (right now) clients to chat through a server and send files to 
this server. In the future it's ment to implement the possibility for clients
to obtain these files as well as login/logout, add friends, create chatrooms 
and more.

### If you want to try it
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Import project to your IDE (as usually)
2. Configure project settings in src/globalsettings/GlobalSettings.java.
3. Run src/server/ServerLauncher.java
4. Run src/client/ClientLauncher.java
5. Start Server (Follow GUI intructions)
6. Connect Client (Follow GUI instructions)
7. Have a shitload of fun

**OBS:** If you want to use it with multiple clients on multiple PC/MAC's 
you should change the HOST_ADDRESS in src/globalsettings/GlobalSettings.java 
to the ip address of the server computer.
